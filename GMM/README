Implementation of Gaussian mixture model for the Mini-project

External libraries:
armadillo v6.1

Input files are specified within mainGMM.cpp (the variable "filename").
It is assumed that input files are pure data files containing only numbers (N rows D columns)

Other parameters to be set within mainGMM.cpp:
"numRuns": total number of runs of the EM algorithm
"maxIter": maximum iteration count for a run of EM

Compile the code with
$ make

Run GMM with K clusters with
$ ./GMM K

Output will be saved in the working directory:
MU.out - contains mean parameters of the clusters
SIGMA.out - contains covariance matrices
PI.out - contains mixture coefficients
GAMMA.out - contains responsibilities
logL_hist.out - contains history of log likelihood for the best run of the EM


Data files:
datas/toyclusters.dat - used for Figure 7
postprocessing with Matlab
matlabGmmFiles/ - contains a matlab implementation of GMM and post-processing script that generated Figure 7.
