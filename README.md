Mini-Projects for MPhil in Scientific Computing, University of Cambridge

Implement and compare different methods for clustering:
1) K-Means
2) Mixture of Gaussians
3) Dirichlet Process Mixture Model

The DPM in particular is very exciting. Implementation uses a Gaussian Likelihood and a Normal-Inverse-Wishart prior. 
Sampling is done using "Algorithm 2" in Neal(2000).

Written in C++ using the Armadillo library. Prototyped in Matlab.

Tested on various data sets
