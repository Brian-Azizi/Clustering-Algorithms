K-means implementation for the Mini-project

External libraries:
armadillo v6.1

Input files must are specified within main.cpp (using the variable "filename").
It is assumed that input files contain only the data (N rows, D columns).

Other parameters that are specified in main.cpp:
The maximum number of iterations: "max_iter"
The total number of runs of the algorithm: num_runs
 
Compile the code using
$ make

To run the algorithm with K clusters, use
$ ./kmeans K

Output will be saved in the working directory:
"idx.out" : contains the cluster identities
"centroids.out": contains the cluster centroids

Data files:
"datas/toyclusters.dat" was used for Figures 1 and 2
"datas/demo.dat" was used for Figure 3
"imSeg/polar.dat" was used for Figure 4

Figures were post-processed with matlab 
An implementation of K-means can be found in "matlab_files" (uncommented as it is not part of the project)
the script used for generating the plots is "matlab_files/mainKMEANS.m"
Figures were edited using Inkscape
