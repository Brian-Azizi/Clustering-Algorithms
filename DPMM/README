Implementation of Dirichlet process mixture model with Gaussian likelihood and normal-inverse-wishart prior

External libraries:
armadillo v6.1

Requires C++11

Input files are specified in mainDPM.cpp ("inputFile" variable).

Other parameters to be set within mainDPM.cpp
initial_K - initial number of clusters
alpha - concentration parameter
S_0, nu_0, m_0, k_0 - prior hyperparameters
NUM_SWEEPS - number of Gibbs sampler iterations
BURN_IN - burn-in for Gibbs sampler
SAVE_CHAIN - boolean. Set true to save entire markov chain. 

Compile with
$ make

Run with
$ ./DPM

Output will be saved in working directory:
dpmMU.out - contains final sample of cluster means
dpmSIGMA.out - contains final sample of cluster covariances
dpmIDX.out - contains final cluster assignments
chainK.out - contains Markov chain samples of K

if SAVE_CHAIN is set to true, we additionally output the samples of the entire markov chain (minus the burn-in):
chainClusters.out
chainClusterSizes.out
chainMu.out
chainSigma.out

Data files:
datas/demo.dat - data used for Figures 7, 8 and 9
Postprocessing scripts used are in demo/iter and demo/size

datas/monarch.dat - data used for Figure 10. Postprocessed with tests/DPMquantization.m

figures were edited with inkscape
